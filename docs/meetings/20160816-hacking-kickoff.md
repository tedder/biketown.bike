Freeform notes by Ted

attending: Sarah I., Adron, Ted



who does the biketown app? can we do extensions? (e.g., notify free bike claims)
who does the open-source coding from sobi?

trip data:
- ride tracking and smiley/frowny/sweaty
- desire paths: how do people use non-bikeways?
  * will tend towards what they think is safe
  * "if bikes are going there anyhow, we need to make sure it's safe"

free bike data:

station data:
- can show empty and full stations
- pushing edges as indicator of demand: whose voice isn't included? why here, not some other place? overlay income/transit; look at riding to connections. how are people served by connectivity interfaces?
- think about this as transit, public good. what about bikeshare corridors (like streetcar, etc). for instance: green line to outer SE bus service), buffer zone like 6 blocks out 82nd to Division  (think about them like trains, not bikes). Cost of bikeshare vs rail vs brt; maybe michael andersonc ould help with those numbers?


ridership data:


subscription data:
- no credit card, how to track this and tight income?

low income signup:
- month/day/ondemand breakdown/psu
